# Details

- Files are formatted using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) site generation framework, which also supports a server for local development (i.e. `hugo server`)
- Added docker-compose.yml to support running in local
- hugo can be installed and build, run with server in local without using docker-compose if needed.
